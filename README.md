# BookMyTrip - Travel Management and Booking System

Our team collaborated on a DBMS group project to develop **BookMyTrip**, a comprehensive travel management and booking system. Leveraging a stack of modern technologies such as **React.js**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MySQL**, **Axios**, **Bootstrap**, and **Material UI**, we created a practical and user-friendly platform for travel operations. 

## Project Overview

BookMyTrip focuses on essential features to ensure users have a seamless experience in planning and managing their trips. Key functionalities include:

- **User Authentication**: Secure email OTP-based registration, ensuring a reliable and straightforward sign-up process.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Users remain logged in until they choose to log out, eliminating the need for repeated logins.
- **Booking Functionalities**: A dummy flight booking facility with real flight details and prices, allowing users to simulate the booking experience.
- **Checkout and Payment**: A dedicated checkout page and a dummy payment page, ensuring a complete booking workflow.
- **Ticket Management**: Users can download tickets for their booked flights directly from the platform.
- **Booking Management**: Features to view booked flights, add and view third-party bookings, and book real tickets (other than flights) by filling in the details on our website, which then redirects to the actual service provider's website.
- **And much more** small but necessary features that enhance the overall user experience and functionality.
